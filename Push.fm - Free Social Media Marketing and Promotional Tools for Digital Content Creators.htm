<p>At PUSH, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service today, tomorrow, and in the future. Your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data.</p>
<p>That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below.</p>

<p>The Policy applies to all PUSH services and any associated services (referred to as the ‘PUSH Service’). The terms governing your use of the PUSH Service are defined in our Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms and Conditions of Use”).</p>
<p>From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services.

Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.</p>
<p>The aim of this Policy is to: 1. Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with; 2.

<p>We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you. For information on how to contact us if you ever have any questions or concerns, please visit our contact form. Alternatively, if you do not agree with the content of this Policy, then please remember it is your choice whether you want to use the PUSH Service.</p>
<p><strong>Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control</strong></p>
